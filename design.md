Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(opens in a new tab). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
Log Dataset
https://github.com/Interana/eventsim
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator(opens in a new tab) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

Log JSON Metadata
The log_json_path.json file is used when loading JSON data into Redshift. It specifies the structure of the JSON data so that Redshift can properly parse and load it into the staging tables.

In the context of this project, you will need the log_json_path.json file in the COPY command, which is responsible for loading the log data from S3 into the staging tables in Redshift. The log_json_path.json file tells Redshift how to interpret the JSON data and extract the relevant fields. This is essential for further processing and transforming the data into the desired analytics tables.

Below is what data is in log_json_path.json.

Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and event datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

Fact Table
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
Dimension Tables
users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
Project Template
To get started with the project, go to the workspace on the next page, where you'll find the project template. You can work on your project and submit your work through this workspace.

Alternatively, you can download the template files in the Resources tab in the classroom and work on this project on your local computer.

The project template includes four files:

create_table.py is where you'll create your fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
etl.py is where you'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
sql_queries.py is where you'll define you SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.
README.md is where you'll provide discussion on your process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

Project Setup Checklist
Make sure you have all the resources ready to go for this project before you complete it.







Project Steps
Below are steps you can follow to complete each component of this project.

Create Table Schemas
Design schemas for your fact and dimension tables
Write a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in sql_queries.py
Complete the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and create these tables
Write SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist. This way, you can run create_tables.py whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.
Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
Add redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
Test by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database. You can use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.
Build ETL Pipeline
Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
Test by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
Delete your redshift cluster when finished.
Document Process
Do the following steps in your README.md file. Here's a guide(opens in a new tab) on Markdown Syntax.

Discuss the purpose of this database in context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis. We do not provide you any of these. You, as part of the Data Engineering team were tasked to build this ETL. Thorough study has gone into the star schema, tables, and columns required. The ETL will be effective and provide the data and in the format required. However, as an exercise, it seems almost silly to NOT show SOME examples of potential queries that could be ran by the users. PLEASE use your imagination here. For example, what is the most played song? When is the highest usage time of day by hour for songs? It would not take much to imagine what types of questions that corporate users of the system would find interesting. Including those queries and the answers makes your project far more compelling when using it as an example of your work to people / companies that would be interested. You could simply have a section of sql_queries.py that is executed after the load is done that prints a question and then the answer.

Note
The SERIAL command in Postgres is not supported in Redshift. The equivalent in redshift is IDENTITY(0,1), which you can read more on in the Redshift Create Table Docs(opens in a new tab).

Project Rubric
Read the project rubric(opens in a new tab) before and during development of your project to ensure you meet all specifications.
